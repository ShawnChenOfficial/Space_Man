# Space Man

This is a Game development project while the author was studying in 2nd year of BIT.

# General
This game is based on the unity engine, and combines the adventural concept, traditional 2D platform and some ideas, which is derived from another game ‘Cat Mario’. The simple UI design of this game enables a wide arrange of players no matter which country, or what language they are speaking.
The complexity of AI design increases a lot of difficulty to players, such as unexpected traps, monster designs that will actively attack players. So, the game will be more attracting the players who want challenges.
